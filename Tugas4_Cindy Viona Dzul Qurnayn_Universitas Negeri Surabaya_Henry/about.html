            offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computing, history, art history, economics, and more, including K-14 and test preparation (SAT, Praxis, LSAT) content. We focus on skill mastery to help learners establish strong foundations, so there's no limit to what they can learn next!

            We are working hard to ensure that Khan Academy empowers coaches of all kinds to better understand what their children or students are up to and how best to help them. See at a glance whether a child or student is struggling or if she hit a streak and is now far ahead of the class. Our teacher dashboard provides a summary of class performance as a whole as well as detailed student profiles.
